FA_minedetector
==

**Description**<br/>
Server-side addon to make minedetectors useful on higher difficulty settings. Players with a mine detector will hear a crescending high-pitched sound the closer they get to a mine. The sound is very audible to themselves but very faint to people in their close vincinity.

**Usage**<br/>
Download .zip and run the pbo as addon on your server. Requires CBA.

**Version history**<br/>
v1 - 12/03/2015 - initial release
v2 - 12/03/2015 - added directional detection and misc. tweaks

** Known issues**<br/>
The sound can appear to 'lag' behind the player's movement. This is because it is played from the player's eyes as 'source'. Thus, head movement can make the sound appear positional.
